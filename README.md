#### The app has following packages:
1. **data**: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
2. **di**: Dependency providing classes using Dagger2.
3. **ui**: View classes along with their corresponding ViewModel.
4. **utils**: Utility classes.

#### Classes have been designed in such a way that it could be inherited and maximize the code reuse.
